This project is an ebook ecommerce site, from which users can make purchases for selected ebooks. This website was developed using the py4web server, with the back end being in python using sqlite for the databases, and the front end using html and javascript.


The main pages featured on this site are a home page, an index/browsing page, a shopping cart page, a wishlist page, and an info page for each ebook. There is also a purchase button that takes the user to a transaction page that is from the Stripe API.
